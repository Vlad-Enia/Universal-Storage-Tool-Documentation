                This report serves as a User Guide for the UNST application made by Enia Vlad Ieftimie, Gaina Robert-Adrian and Iurea Marius, 
                during the second semester of 2020-2021 at the University of Computer Science Alexandru Ioan Cuza from Iasi.
            </p>
            <p>
                This app is designed to be intuitive and its use does not require a lot of knowledge. However this guide servers as a way of
                 informing the users about all the options available in UNST.

            <p>
                The access to UNST platform is currently restricted to only the users that are registered on the platform.

                to be redirected to the Register page.
            </p>
            <p>
                An account can be registered to the UNST platform by providing and email, a username and a password. If the username AND email
                 is already taken you will need to chose other credentials. Passwords must match and be at least 5 characters long.
            </p>
            <p>
                After registering you will be able to connect to the UNST platform with your new credentials.

            </h2>
            <p>
                This page is responsible with accessing your files and the other pages. On the top side you can see the navigation bar from where 
                you can go between all the other pages of the app or logout from your account. You can also see a search bar that should allow you to find your file quicker.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the left side of your screen you should see the a similar file structure with most other apps and informations related to your connected clouds.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the middle of the page you can see the file you have uploaded and informations about them. By pressing  the "ADD A FILE" button you can quickly select a file from your computer and then add it to your clouds based on the settings previously selected.
            </p>

                4. File Uploader
            </h2>
            <p>
                When a file is uploaded from the Main Page it will be saved to the drives you have connected based on the settings selected. Keep in mind that even if the files are on your cloud accounts, you will need to
                download them from the UNST platform if they were uploaded as file shards, encrypted files OR compressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                When uploading a file to the UNST platform the file will be saved to our servers during the preprocessing part. However all the data will be deleted after the upload is completed.
                Because this service is intended to support big files, we are using resumable transfer protocols that might take some time. Keep in mind that your file might not be available from the first second you've pressed that upload button.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are some settings for the app that can be preselected from the Config Cloud account like deleting the uploaded files from a drive when disconnecting, the file splitting method or their distribution on the clouds.

                This section presents the process that your files go through from the moment you press the Upload button until they are safely stored into your selected clouds.
            </p>
            <p>
                After sending the file to our servers, UNST will distribute the file into smaller pieces, named "shards" based on the settings provided in the Cloud and Bandwidth page. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After the file is split, all the shards will be distributed into your drives based on the settings provided. Remember that a drive must be connected in order to be able to upload a file there.

                This section presents the process that your files go through from the moment you press Download the button until they are safely stored into your selected clouds.
            </p>
            <p>
                After sending the download request to our servers, UNST will try to recover all the shards dat compose the file requested. If the files were encrypted or compressed the operations will be reverted and then the initial file will be recomposed by the UNST server.
                After the reconstruction is complete it will be downloaded to your computer.

            </h2>
            <p>
                The structure of the UNST app is made in order to allow the creation of files and folders starting from the root of your account. Therefore we are able to create a file system tree without storing the absolute path and only referring to the immediate upper scope.
                This makes our application faster with operations that change this file structure by simply moving a single node in the database.

            <p>
               Currently UNST allows the user to connect to 3 different drives: Dropbox, Microsoft One Drive and Google Drive. The connection with these external applications are
               created using the oAuth2 protocol so we are not storing any information related to your account credentials. When you are first connecting to a drive you will be redirected to the
               Drive oAuth server that will generate an access token based on your account credentials. This way you can access your account without sharing personal information with us

                In conclusion this app comes in handy for the people that would like to keep their file more secure by distributing them to multiple clouds 
                or to be sure that they use every bit available of storage.
